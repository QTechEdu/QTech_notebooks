    - specifiy the path to a notebook file (PhyQ_JJ.ipynb);
    - create Binder Configuration Files in the repository's root directory which will be used to build a Docker image:
                - requirements.txt for Python packages;
                - runtime.txt to specify the Python version if needed (for example: python-3.8);

      and define the required resources. 
      For CPU usage, you can specify the required number of CPU cores (For example: cpu: 2)
    - generate a link that allows to launch your repository in an interactive Jupyter environment.
